I will move this to a wiki eventually but just for compiling succesfully with wheels the zerorpc library you need:

FROM resin/armv7hf-debian:stretch AS buildstep

RUN apt-cache policy
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -yq \
 gcc \
 python3 \
 python3-pip \
 python3-setuptools \
 python3-dev \
 libffi-dev \
 libcurl4-openssl-dev \
 libzmq3-dev \
 && \
 apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip

RUN pip3 install wheel

# Install required Python packages
RUN pip3 wheel --wheel-dir=/root/wheels \
 cffi==1.11.5 \
 zerorpc

FROM resin/armv7hf-debian:stretch

RUN apt-cache policy
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -yq \
 python3 \
 python3-pip \
 libzmq3-dev \
 && \
 apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY --from=buildstep /root/wheels /root/wheels

RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip

RUN pip3 install wheel

RUN pip3 install \
      --no-index \
      --find-links=/root/wheels \
 cffi==1.11.5 \
 zerorpc

which creates an image of about 161MB (the original resin/armv7hf-debian:stretch is 90.3 MB), this is too much I think,
we are going to try to move on from this library in the future.
